  <div class="post">
    <p>I wrote this thing for my sister for xmas. It’s a stuffed pig. Inside it I have stuffed an old, cracked-screen iPhone 4. I’ve pre-recorded a bunch of (horrible, generally insulting, hopefully funny) phrases that it will play when you shake it. It’s the simplest iOS app I’ve ever written. If I have time, I’ll give it the ability to recieve push notifications so that I can make it talk whenever I want. I’m pretty compressed on time, though, so I’ll probably hold off.</p>

<p>Brief rant: it’s pretty insane that in order to make this thing for my sister I have to stuff an <em>iPhone</em> into a stuffed animal. That in turn gives it plenty of drawbacks, like the fact that you have to keep it plugged in. I searched all over the place for an off-the-shelf component that could do this, and while approximately 500000 cheapo kits will let you record a message onto some flash storage and push a button to play it, none of them let you record multiple sounds. Bananas. I also considered building it with an Arduino, which would have the advantage of letting me throw a few 9V batteries on it and have it be able to run for a really long time. Given my general lack of experience with Arduino/hardware programming, though, I think I would have had about a 0% chance of success, especially given that I’m racing to get this done before flying home in 48 hours. iOS is cool, but goddamn this feels like overkill.</p>

<p>Anyways the source is <a href="https://github.com/jflinter/Pigotron">here</a>. If you want to make your own thing, just stick a bunch of .wav files in the bundle directory and when you shake the phone it’ll play one of them at random. Then cut open a stuffed animal and unceremoniously cram it in there. I might add a miniature speaker so that I can play sounds directly out of the pig’s mouth, but I’m running out of space in there.</p>

<p>Oh, and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Melissa-Doug-Sweater-Sweetie-Pig/dp/B007EA51HQ/ref=sr_1_14?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1387679417&amp;sr=8-14&amp;keywords=stuffed+pig">this</a> is the pig I found on Amazon.</p>

<p>Woo!</p>
